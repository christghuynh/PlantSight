PlantSight was made as a project for Ignition Hacks 2024

# Overview
PlantSight aims to aid those with impaired vision in enabling a carefree environment during walks on trails. The application uses the Google Gemini model to accurately identify dangerous plants and alert the user through text to speech, as well as the OpenCV library to enable live processing of the video camera. Flask was used to develop the web application and implement the AI model of PlantSight.
