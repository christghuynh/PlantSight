# Dataset
For PlantSight, we are using the plant dataset Pl@ntNet-300K, containing 306,146 plant images of 1081 species.

# Overview
PlantSight aims to aid those with impaired vision in enabling a carefree environment during walks on trails. The application uses the YOLOv8 deep learning algorithm to accurately identify dangerous plants and alert the user through text to speech. Flask was used to develop the web application and implement the AI model of PlantSight.
